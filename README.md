## Goal
This paper proposes a feature-driven compressor-agnostic fixed-ratio framework **FXRZ**, which can efficiently estimate the expected error bound setting based on a user-specified compression ratio. Please check the paper for more details.

## Introduction to Different Sections of This Repo
* Baseline: this folder contains the code and evaluations of the baseline [FRaZ](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9139812), which is a high-cost generic fixed-ratio framework.
* Compressor-executables: this folder describes how to execute each of our evaluated compressors.
* FXRZ-Workflow: this folder provides code and step-by-step instructions of how to install and run our framework FXRZ.
* Testing-Dataset: we provide a sample testing dataset to test our framework FXRZ.
